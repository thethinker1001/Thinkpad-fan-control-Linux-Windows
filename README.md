# Thinkpad-fan-control-Linux-Windows
Simple softwares to control fan speed in [ beloved ] thinkpad laptops , supporting windows and linux too !

After many searches I finally found the solution to manage the inefficient fan speed on my favorite thinkpad
Has been tested on my Thinkpad t440p on Linux & Windows
Both programs are graphical, because why should mess with cli when you can click on buttons!
